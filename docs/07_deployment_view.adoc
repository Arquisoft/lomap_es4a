== Deployment View

=== Development Diagram

While in development, the LoMap system will be run in the developer's computer. The system will be deployed in the developer's computer using Docker images which contain the necesary programs to run the application as a standalone application. Prometheus and Grafana will monitor and give information about the restapi. As it is shown in the diagram, the SOLID PODs, as well as the Maps API, are not part of the LoMap system.
While the application is being developed, the MongoDB database will be allocated in the developer's computer. This will not be the case when the application is deployed.

=== Deployment Diagram

While in deployment run in a Server. The users will connect to this server to access the application for the most part in the user's device, whether it is a smartphone or a personal computer. The system will be deployed using Docker images. The webapp is the part of the system that the users will interact with. The restapi will be in charge of integrating all the other parts of the system and using external components such as SOLID PODs and a Maps API.
