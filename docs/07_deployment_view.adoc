== Deployment View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. the technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. the mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document the deployment view when your software is executed as distributed system with more then one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture those elements of the infrastructure that are needed to show the deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe the infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence your system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, you need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe the highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section you will
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than the deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.

== Development Diagram

While in development, the LoMap system will be run in the developer's computer. The system will be deployed in the developer's computer using Docker images which contain the necesary programs to run the application as a standalone application. Prometheus and Grafana will monitor and give information about the restapi. As it is shown in the diagram, the SOLID PODs, as well as the Maps API, are not part of the LoMap system.
While the application is being developed, the MongoDB database will be allocated in the developer's computer. This will not be the case when the application is deployed.

== Deployment Diagram

While in deployment run in a Server. The users will connect to this server to access the application for the most part in the user's device, whether it is a smartphone or a personal computer. The system will be deployed using Docker images. The webapp is the part of the system that the users will interact with. The restapi will be in charge of integrating all the other parts of the system and using external components such as MongoDB, SOLID PODs and a Maps API.

The following image is a legend that can be useful to understand the information shown in the diagrams.
