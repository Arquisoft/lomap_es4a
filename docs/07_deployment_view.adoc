== Deployment View

=== Development Diagram

While in development, the LoMap system will be run in the developer's computer. The system will be deployed in the developer's computer using a Docker image which contains the necesary programs to run the application as a standalone application. As it is shown in the diagram, the SOLID PODs, as well as the Maps API, are not part of the LoMap system.
While the application is being developed, there is a Docker image that runs the webapp. This will not be the case when the application is deployed.

While in deployment the application will run in GitHub pages on another repository. The users will connect to GitHub pages to access the application, for the most part through the user's device. The webapp is the part of the system that the users will interact with.
