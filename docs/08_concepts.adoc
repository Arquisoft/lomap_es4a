== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain Concept

User: This represents a client of the application. They can add other users as Friends, and they have a map to mark their favourite places too. We get their information through the POD.

Map: This represents the users map of the app. Contains the markers made by the user.

Mark: This class represents the Marker made by the user with his name, user score, a Location and a list of all times comments.

Comment: This represents a comment made in a marked location by a certain user with all his information including the posting time and rate of the user.

Location: This contains the longitude and latitude of the Marker.

### Technical Decisions

The technical decisions taken were explained in more detail in the section 04 of the documentation titled 'Solution Strategy'. For further information about the technical decisions, please check the section https://github.com/Arquisoft/lomap_es4a/blob/master/docs/04_solution_strategy.adoc[04 Solution Strategy].
