The components of the application use certain technologies and communicate with eachother using different channels. The LoMap application will be programmed mostly using TypeScript and the React framework. The Pod will be a SOLID POD. The connections that happen between LoMap and the user's device follow the https protocol and the connection between the user's device and the SOLID PODs follow the https protocol, so the information is secure. LoMap will use a Google Maps API, and the connections will use http.
